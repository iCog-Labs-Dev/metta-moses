;; A function to remove some subsumable selections from the point of application (POA).
;; Definitions: An AND node N commands every node which is a descendent of N's
;;                parent but which is neither N nor a descendent of N.
;;              A guard set of a POA is the set of literals in the POA.
;;              The command set of a node N is the union of the
;;                guard sets of the AND nodes in the tree which
;;                command N and which have guard sets containing
;;                only one constraint each,
;; Preconditions: The point of application (POA) is a non root AND node,
;;                 the POA's guard set contains constraint X and
;;                 the POA is commanded by a terminal AND node COM
;;                 whose guard set consists of the constraint X.
;; Action: The function removes the POA from it's parent if applied, else it returns the POA.
;;            In addition to the POA, this function also returns the updated parent.
;;            It also returns a boolean value corresponding to whether the transformation function
;;            is applied or not.
;; Example: input: POA ==> (AND E D), commandSet ==> (C D), parent ==> (OR (AND E D) C)
;;        : output: ((OR C) () True)
