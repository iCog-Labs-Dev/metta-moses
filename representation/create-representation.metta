;; In our simplified approach, we're not using dynamic feature selection
;; or ignore operators. This significantly streamlines the representation
;; creation process compared to the original implementation.
;;
;; The original code handles several complex scenarios:
;; 1. Dynamic feature selection to reduce the number of features used
;; 2. Creating multiple representations with different feature sets
;; 3. Pruning exemplars based on selected features
;; 4. Enforcing specific features
;; 5. Creating ignore_ops sets for non-selected features
;;
;; Our simplified version just creates a single representation directly
;; from the exemplar without any feature filtering or manipulation.
;; This is equivalent to the "no dynamic feature selection" path in
;; the original code, but even simpler as we don't use ignore_ops either.
;;
;; The simplified representation creation can be expressed as:
;; calling the representation constructor directly on the exemplar tree

;; create representation 
;; Params:
;;   $tree: The exemplar tree
;;   $argLabels: list of argument labels (input variables) from the ITable
;; Returns: Representation
 (: createRepresentation (-> (Tree $a) Expression Representation))
(= (createRepresentation $tree $argLabels)
    (representation $tree $argLabels)
